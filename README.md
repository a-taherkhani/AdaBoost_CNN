# How to run

-To run the AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN on the synthetic data run ‘test2_CNN.py’.

-The code will generate random synthetic data, and it trains and tests the two methods (AdaBoost-CNN and a single CNN) on this data.

-The variable ‘n_estimators’ before ‘Ada_CNN’ has been set to 10. It determines the number of estimators in the AdaBoost-CNN.

-The variable ‘epoch’ sets the number of training epochs of a CNN estimator in the AdaBoost-CNN.

# How to run on Google colan:

'Adaboost_CNN_colab.ipynb' can be used to run Adaboost_CNN on on Google Colab.
